=========

An instance of a Panda3D project intended to be a prototype of a game architecture for use in a larger game. In particular I want to implement a sort of event- and message-based architecture along with some hopefully decent standard PC and Xinput handling.


License
=======

I intend to use a modified GPL v3 license with this project, under which redistribution will be allowed only for free and only as uncompiled source. I will update this readme when I have the license added to the repo.
